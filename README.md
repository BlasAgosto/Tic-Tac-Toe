TIC! 
    TAC!    
        TOE! PEOPLE!

Introduction:
You know it, you love it, it's tic tac toe. If you'd like to learn more keep reading!

How to play:
Current iteration requires 2 individuals. 
1 person is player X
1 person is player O
You will take turns, 1 at a time choosing to place your player moniker on the game board. 
The game board is comprised of a 9 spaced grid. 
Pick your spot, then let the next player choose theirs. 

How to win:
Here's what matters! You want to get 3 of your own monikers to be adjacent to each other completing 3 in a row. 
Either vertically, horizontally, or by making a diagonal line from one corner the the opposite end corner. 
First player to do that wins it all!
Pink slips, home deads, first-borns, you name it. Winner takes it all. 

If however neither of you are able to win, the game ends in a tie and you're both shame upon your bloodline. 
Restart the game and keep playing until someone wins. 
This is non-negotiable.
